## **🎨 Visual Design System**

### **Color Psychology**
```css
🟢 Available (#4CAF50)   → Ready for coffee, friendly green
🟠 Maybe (#FF9800)       → Uncertain but possible, warm orange  
🔴 Busy (#F44336)        → Not available, clear red
☕ Coffee Theme          → Warm browns and creams throughout
```

### **Animation Philosophy**
```
Smooth 60fps animations that feel magical:
├── Radar sweep rotation (continuous 4s loop)
├── Center pulse animation (1s breathing effect)
├── Friend dot selection feedback (scale + haptic)
├── Entrance animations (fade + slide)
└── Coordination spinner (satisfying feedback)
```

### **Accessibility Features**
```
Universal design principles:
├── High contrast color combinations
├── Large touch targets (30px minimum)
├── Haptic feedback for all interactions
├── Clear status indicators and messaging
└── Graceful fallbacks for all features
```

## **🔧 Implementation Details**

### **Real-Time Features**
```typescript
// Smart timeout handling for reliable UX
const fetchWithTimeout = async (url: string, timeout = 3000) => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### **Offline-First Architecture**
```typescript
// Graceful degradation when backend unavailable
try {
  const response = await fetchWithTimeout('/api/radar/friends-availability');
  // Use real-time data
} catch (error) {
  // Fall back to local storage + smart simulation
  const localData = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('userContacts');
  // Generate intelligent mock availability
}
```

### **Context-Aware Recommendations**
```python
# Backend intelligence for perfect spot suggestions
def recommend_coffee_spots(group_size, weather, time_of_day):
    score = base_score
    if group_size > 4 and "Social" in spot.vibe:
        score += 10  # Boost social spots for large groups
    if weather == "rainy" and "Indoor" in spot.features:
        score += 15  # Prioritize indoor spots when raining
    return sorted_recommendations
```
